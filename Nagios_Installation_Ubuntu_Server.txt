# Nagios_Installation_Ubuntu

**Prerequisites**
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 libgd-dev openssl libssl-dev

**PHP Installation** "I'm using PHP7.2 for pdf generation report"
sudo apt-get update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt-get install -y php7.2

**Downloading the Source**
cd /tmp
wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.5.1.tar.gz
tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz

**Compile**
cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.5.1/
sudo ./configure --with-httpd-conf=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled
sudo make all

**Create User And Group** "This creates the nagios user and group. The www-data user is also added to the nagios group."
sudo make install-groups-users
sudo usermod -a -G nagios www-data

**Install Binaries** "This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files."
sudo make install

**Install Service / Daemon** "This installs the service or daemon files and also configures them to start on boot."
sudo make install-daemoninit

**Install Command Mode** "This installs and configures the external command file."
sudo make install-commandmode

**Install Configuration Files** "This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files. These are required as Nagios needs some configuration files to allow it to start."
sudo make install-config

**Install Apache Config Files** "This installs the Apache web server configuration files and configures Apache settings."
sudo make install-webconf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod cgi

**Configure Firewall** "You need to allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall so you can reach the Nagios Core web interface."
sudo ufw allow Apache
sudo ufw reload

**Create nagiosadmin User Account** "You'll need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios."
The following command will create a user account called nagiosadmin and you will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Note: "When adding additional users in the future, you need to remove -c from the above command otherwise it will replace the existing nagiosadmin user (and any other users you may have added)."


**Start Apache Web Server** "Need to restart it because it is already running."
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service

**Start Service / Daemon** "This command starts Nagios Core."
sudo systemctl start nagios.service

**Test Nagios** "Nagios is now running, to confirm this you need to log into the Nagios Web Interface."
Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

http://10.25.5.143/nagios
http://core-013.domain.local/nagios

You will be prompted for a username and password. The username is nagiosadmin (you created it in a previous step) and the password is what you provided earlier.

Once you have logged in you are presented with the Nagios interface. Congratulations you have installed Nagios Core.

BUT WAIT ...
Currently you have only installed the Nagios Core engine. You'll notice some errors under the hosts and services along the lines of:

(No output on stdout) stderr: execvp(/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_load, ...) failed. errno is 2: No such file or directory 
These errors will be resolved once you install the Nagios Plugins, which is covered in the next step.



#Installing The Nagios Plugins "Nagios Core needs plugins to operate properly. The following steps will walk you through installing Nagios Plugins."

**Prerequisites**
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget bc gawk dc build-essential snmp libnet-snmp-perl gettext

**Compile + Install**
cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-release-2.4.6/
sudo ./tools/setup
